# Stanford-CS231n
These are my attempt to solve the Assignments for CS231n
I have taken a lot of help from https://github.com/MyHumbleSelf/cs231n and https://github.com/bruceoutdoors/CS231n 

##Some tips and links I have written down while working with assignments

###Assignment 1

KNN no loops - great talk by Jake https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEUXKG97YRw

a very useful way to get all the scores of correct labels - used very often throughout
say we have matrix scores (N,C) here N is num_training and C is num_classes
y is matrix of correct labels (N,)

to get the scores scores[range(N),y] that is it.

linear_svm- http://cs231n.github.io/linear-classify/#svm
softmax_classifier -   http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-case-study/#grad very useful
neural_net - http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-case-study/ code can be directly copy pasted just some minor changes needed
